        Yummy combination of beef, pork, and sausage topped with caramelized
        tomato soup. My favorite meatloaf recipe by far. Worth every ingredient!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>
            Place the onion and carrots into a saucepan, and pour in the beef
            broth. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and reduce heat to a simmer;
            cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are tender, about 8
            minutes. Set the veggies and broth aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, beat the eggs, and stir in bread crumbs, basil,
            salt, and black pepper. Allow the mixture to stand for 5 minutes
            to moisten the crumbs, and lightly mix in the turkey, beef, and
            pork sausage. Mix in the cooked onions, carrots, and beef broth.
            Place the mixture into the prepared loaf pan. In a bowl, mix the
            tomato soup, balsamic vinegar, and Dijon mustard together, and
            spread the mixture over the meat loaf.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake until the loaf is no longer pink in the center and an
            instant-read meat thermometer reads at least 160 degrees F
            (70 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours.
        </li>
    </ol>
